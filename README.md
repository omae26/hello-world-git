# hello-world-git
For learning and testing git
I built this repository while learning about the Basics of Git via a Udemy course.
I understood most of the things but some of the passed above my brain. I'm planning to take the next initiative to dog deeper and learn more key Git concepts. But this course was worth every minute.
